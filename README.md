# Boids

Flocking particle simulation following the properties of Boids: Separation forces, Attraction/Cohesion forces, and Alignment forces.

Included functionality for predators in which the boids will avoid as well as static obstacles for both the boids and predators to avoid. Note: The predators will also avoid each other.

Left clicking the mouse will place a predator on the mouse cursor while right clicking the mouse will remove the oldest predator. The three static obstacles that are generated cannot be removed nor moved.
